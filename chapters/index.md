Overview
========

These four standalone workshops aim to help Python users understand language
features, packages, and programming strategies that will enable them to write
more efficient code, be more productive when writing code, and debug code more
effectively. This is not an introduction to Python and is appropriate for
motivated intermediate to advanced users who want a better understanding of
working with Python for their research.


Learning Objectives
-------------------

After completing all four Intermediate Python workshops, learners should be
able to:

* Identify problems that can be solved efficiently with Pandas indexing
* Use Pandas indexes and multi-indexes to extract subsets of data
* Convert between columns and (multi-)indexes in a Pandas data frame
* Organize project files using modules and namespaces
* Install and remove Python, Python packages, and other software with conda
* Explain how Python’s iterators and generators work
* Determine the cause(s) of bugs in code using Python’s debugging tools


Prerequisites
-------------

Participants are expected to have taken DataLab’s [Python Basics workshop
series][python-basics] and/or have prior experience using Python, be
comfortable with basic Python syntax, and have it pre-installed and running on
their laptops.
